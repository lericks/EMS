This is a simple Employee Management System.

*Key Implementations*
PDF Report Generation [The system uses iText library to generate these]

Table with Selectable contents [The system uses event listners to capture selected row and display its related contents]

Database configurations

Database username : root , Password : password , port : 3306 This is preset in the code through out the classes. Not a brilliant idea but it works. The database SQL Script file is on the default directory it is named ems.sql

User account for accessing the system is username : admin password : admin this can be viewed in the database table.

To run the application open the .jar file in the dist folder or on Netbeans IDE
